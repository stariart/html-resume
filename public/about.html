<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Sara and I live and breathe in the city of Southampton, on the south coast of the UK.
  I love anything to do with art and design.
  Symmetry is a passion of mine, and I love anything to do with mandala's and sacred geometry.
</p>

<p>I have been making no-code websites for a few years now, all self taught on various platforms, but I am currently studying coding, and LOVING the learning process so far!</p>

<p>I can't wait to show the world what I can do! and at the matured age of 45 years old, I still LOVE to learn!
  My family and loved ones call me a human sponge!

<h3>Hobbies & Interests</h3>
<p>I very much enjoy travel, long road trips around the country or abroad.  
Art in many forms from physical painting and sketching to crochet & macrame, 
digital graphic design, photography and most recently self-taught video editing. 
I love my home and enjoy DIY and decorating, gardening & growing my own fruit and 
veg, cooking, films and reading.</p>
